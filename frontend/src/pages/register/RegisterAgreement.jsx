          Terms Of Service Agreement Sample Exhibit 10.36 Execution Copy
          SERVICES AGREEMENT This SERVICES AGREEMENT (this “AGREEMENT”) is made
          as of November 14, 2012 by and between Harbinger Capital Partners LLC,
          a Delaware limited liability company (“HCP”), and Harbinger Group
          Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”) (collectively referred to
          herein as the “Parties”, and each a “Party”). WHEREAS, HCP and certain
          of its affiliated funds (together, the “HCP Entities”) and the Company
          and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries (together, the “Company
          Entities”) desire to enter into this Agreement to set forth the terms
          and conditions upon which the Parties will provide certain ongoing
          services to each other as described herein. NOW, THEREFORE, and in
          consideration of the mutual covenants, rights, and obligations set
          forth in this Agreement, the benefits to be derived therefrom, and
          other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and the sufficiency
          of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows: 1.
          TERM. The term of this Agreement shall commence on November 14, 2012
          and shall continue in effect until terminated by either Party to this
          Agreement following thirty (30) days advance written notice to the
          other Party (the “Term”) or such other amount of days as agreed to by
          the Parties in writing. 2. SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED. (a) During the
          Term, the Company shall, and shall cause the other Company Entities
          to, (i) provide, or cause to be provided, those services and goods to
          the HCP Entities that are reasonably requested by HCP from time to
          time, including office spaces and operational support and (ii) make
          available to the HCP Entities those employees of the Company Entities
          requested by HCP from time to time to perform such services (each, a
          “Company Service Provider”), as reasonably requested by HCP and
          subject to any limitations on the provision of Company Services (as
          defined below) contained in any employment agreement between a Company
          Service Provider and the Company Entities or any other agreement (such
          services listed in clause (i) and (ii) of this Section 2(a), the
          “Company Services”). It is the current intention of the Parties that
          no Company Service Provider spend more than 10% of his or her business
          time per year providing Company Services without the consent of a
          majority of the members of the board of directors of the Company that
          are determined to be “independent” pursuant to the rules of the New
          York Stock Exchange (the “Independent Directors”). (b) The Company
          shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company
          Services to be provided to the HCP Entities; provided that, the
          Company shall be under no obligation, and shall have no obligation to
          cause the other Company Entities, to (A) provide access to any Company
          Service Provider if such person’s employment with any of the Company
          Entities has been terminated or such person refuses 1 or is unable to
          perform Company Services (as defined below); (B) provide any Company
          Service if the Company determines in good faith that any applicable
          law or regulation prevents or prohibits any of the applicable Company
          Entities from providing such Company Service or any of the Company
          Entities is unable to obtain the requisite consents, approvals or
          authorizations to provide such Company Service; (C) provide any
          Company Service if a third party contractor ceases to provide Company
          Services to any of the Company Entities such that such Company Entity
          can no longer provide such Company Service or (D) provide any Company
          Service if any of the Company Entities cease to provide such Company
          Service to itself or its subsidiaries; provided, that in each such
          circumstance described in clauses (A) through (D) of this Section
          2(a), each Party shall cooperate in good faith and use commercially
          reasonable efforts to determine the best alternative approach. The
          Company Services shall be provided on an as-needed, non-exclusive
          basis within a reasonable time after HCP requests such Company
          Services. At any time during the Term, HCP may in its sole discretion
          reduce or increase the level of Company Services or terminate or add
          one or more Company Services on a prospective basis, including
          reducing or increasing the number of Company Service Providers. (c)
          During the Term, HCP shall, and shall cause the other HCP Entities to,
          (i) provide, or cause to be provided, those services and goods to the
          Company Entities that are reasonably requested by the Company from
          time to time, including office spaces and operational support and (ii)
          make available to the Company Entities those employees of the HCP
          Entities requested by the Company from time to time to perform such
          services (each, an “HCP Service Provider”), as reasonably requested by
          the Company and subject to any limitations on the provision of HCP
          Services (as defined below) contained in any employment agreement
          between an HCP Service Provider and the HCP Entities or any other
          agreement (such services listed in clause (i) and (ii) of this Section
          2(b), the “HCP Services”, and together with the Company Services, the
          “Services”). HCP shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
          the HCP Services to be provided to the Company Entities; provided
          that, HCP shall be under no obligation, and shall have no obligation
          to cause the other HCP Entities, to (A) provide access to any HCP
          Service Provider if such person’s employment with any of the HCP
          Entities has been terminated or such person refuses or is unable to
          perform HCP Services; (B) provide any HCP Service if HCP determines in
          good faith that any applicable law or regulation prevents or prohibits
          any of the applicable HCP Entities from providing such HCP Service or
          any of the HCP Entities is unable to obtain the requisite consents,
          approvals or authorizations to provide such HCP Service; (C) provide
          any HCP Service if a third party contractor ceases to provide HCP
          Services to any of the HCP Entities such that such HCP Entity can no
          longer provide such HCP Service or (D) provide any HCP Service if any
          of the HCP Entities cease to provide such HCP Service to itself or its
          affiliated funds; provided, that in each such circumstance described
          in clauses (A) through (D) of this Section 2(b), each Party shall
          cooperate in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to
          determine the best alternative approach. The HCP Services shall be 2
          provided on an as-needed, non-exclusive basis within a reasonable time
          after the Company requests such HCP Services. At any time during the
          Term, the Company may in its sole discretion reduce or increase the
          level of HCP Services or terminate or add one or more HCP Services on
          a prospective basis, including reducing or increasing the number of
          HCP Service Providers. (d) The Parties mutually acknowledge and agree
          that the execution of this Agreement and the performance of Services
          hereunder shall not constitute a breach of, or otherwise contravene
          the terms of any employment agreement or other material agreement or
          contract to which the Company Entities or HCP is a party or otherwise
          bound. Notwithstanding the above, except as expressly set forth
          herein, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Services are
          provided as-is, that the HCP Entities and the Company Entities assume
          all risks and liabilities arising from or relating to its use of and
          reliance upon the Company Services and the HCP Services, respectively,
          and neither the HCP Entities, the Company Entities nor any individual
          providing Services make any representation or warranty with respect
          thereto. Except as expressly set forth herein, the HCP Entities, the
          Company Entities and the individuals providing Services hereby
          expressly disclaim all representations and warranties regarding the
          Services, whether express or implied, including any representation or
          warranty in regard to quality, performance, noninfringement,
          compliance with laws or regulations (domestic and foreign), commercial
          utility, merchantability or fitness of the Services for a particular
          purpose. 3. FEES. (a) In consideration of the provision of the Company
          Services and unless terminated sooner under the terms of this
          Agreement, HCP shall pay to the Company a service fee, which shall be
          calculated to reflect the Base Price (as defined below) for each
          Company Service (such fee, the “Company Service Fee”) and be paid in
          accordance with Section 5 hereof. The Company shall notify HCP in
          writing at any time that, to the best of its knowledge, the Company
          Service Fee does not equal the Base Price. (b) In consideration of the
          provision of the HCP Services and unless terminated sooner under the
          terms of this Agreement, the Company shall pay to HCP a service fee,
          which shall be calculated to reflect the Base Price for each HCP
          Service (such fee, the “HCP Service Fee”) and be paid in accordance
          with Section 5 hereof. HCP shall notify the Company in writing at any
          time that, to the best of its knowledge, the HCP Service Fee does not
          equal the Base Price. (c) For purposes hereof, “Base Price” shall
          mean, with respect to the price of any Service, an amount that is the
          actual cost of such Service (reasonably estimated, to the extent
          required) without any element of profit or other comparable
          compensation, which shall include (i) one-time costs and cash and
          non-cash charges incurred by the provider of such Service, (ii)
          out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred subject to 3 Section 4
          hereof by the provider of such Service, (iii) the cost of any
          consents, approvals, licenses or other agreements required to be
          obtained in order for any Service to be provided; (iv) the hourly rate
          (based on a fully loaded rate that includes all costs of employment,
          including salary, bonus, benefits, expenses and overhead costs
          associated with such employment, including office space and payroll
          costs, but excluding the cost of equity or equity based compensation
          unless the Parties mutually agree otherwise) for each of the
          individuals providing Services under this Agreement; and (iv) pass
          through or allocation of payments made to any party in connection with
          providing the Company Services or the HCP Services. 4. REIMBURSEMENT
          OF CERTAIN COSTS. The Company and HCP shall be entitled to
          reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
          connection with the provision of Services; provided that the Parties
          shall first notify and seek approval from the other Party prior to
          incurring any expense in excess of $100,000 during a single calendar
          quarter. 5. BILLING. (a) The Company shall submit to HCP from time to
          time, but no less frequently than quarterly, an invoice in respect of
          the Company Service Fee and out-of-pocket expenses incurred pursuant
          to Sections 3 and 4, respectively. Invoices will be in such reasonable
          detail as to identify the Company Services provided, the amounts
          charged therefor and any incurred out-of-pocket expenses. Upon written
          request by HCP, the Company shall provide HCP with copies of invoices
          from any third parties for such out-of-pocket expenses. Subject to the
          netting of fees in accordance with this Section 5, HCP shall pay in
          cash to the Company the full amount of the Company Service Fee and
          such approved expenses within thirty (30) days after receipt of such
          invoice from the Company. Within thirty (30) days following the end of
          each calendar year (or such other period of time as the Parties may
          agree to in writing) or following a reasonable amount of time after
          the termination of this Agreement (which shall, solely with respect to
          Taxes (as defined below), extend to six (6) years following the
          termination of this Agreement), the Company shall submit to HCP an
          invoice reflecting any adjustments to the Company Service Fees
          previously paid as a result of mutually agreed changes to the Base
          Price for a Company Service pursuant to Section 3(a) above (the
          “Company True-Up Invoice”). To the extent the Company True-Up Invoice
          requires an additional payment by HCP, the Company may (in its sole
          discretion) determine to apply the amount of such additional payment
          against any future HCP Service Fee(s) or HCP True-Up Invoice(s) (as
          defined below) requiring a payment by the Company, or elect to have
          HCP pay in cash to the Company such amount within thirty (30) days
          after receipt of such invoice. To the extent that the Company True-Up
          Invoice reduces any Company Service Fees previously paid by HCP, HCP
          may (in its sole discretion) determine to apply the amount of such
          reduction against any future Company Service Fee(s) or any HCP True-Up
          Invoice(s) requiring a payment by HCP, or elect to have the Company
          pay such amount in cash to HCP within thirty (30) days after receipt
          of such invoice or the termination of this Agreement. 4 (b) HCP shall
          submit to the Company from time to time, but no less frequently than
          quarterly, an invoice in respect of the HCP Service Fee and
          out-of-pocket expenses incurred pursuant to Sections 3 and 4,
          respectively. Invoices will be in such reasonable detail as to
          identify the HCP Services provided, the amounts charged therefor and
          any incurred out-of-pocket expenses. Upon written request by the
          Company, HCP shall provide the Company with copies of invoices from
          any third parties for such out-of-pocket expenses. Subject to the
          netting of fees in accordance with this Section 5, the Company shall
          pay in cash to HCP the full amount of the HCP Service Fee and such
          approved expenses within thirty (30) days after receipt of such
          invoice from HCP. Within thirty (30) days following the end of each
          calendar year (or such other period of time as the Parties may agree
          to in writing) or following a reasonable amount of time after the
          termination of this Agreement (which shall, solely with respect to the
          Taxes, extend to six (6) years following the termination of this
          Agreement), HCP shall submit to the Company an invoice reflecting any
          adjustments to the HCP Service Fees previously paid as a result of
          mutually agreed changes to the Base Price for an HCP Service pursuant
          to Section 3(b) above (the “HCP True-Up Invoice”). To the extent that
          the HCP True-Up Invoice requires an additional payment by the Company,
          HCP may (in its sole discretion) determine to apply the amount of such
          additional payment against any future Company Service Fee(s) or
          Company True-Up Invoice(s) requiring a payment by HCP, or elect to
          have the Company pay in cash to HCP such amount within thirty (30)
          days after receipt of such invoice. To the extent that the HCP True-Up
          Invoice reduces any HCP Service Fees previously paid by the Company,
          the Company may (in its sole discretion) determine to apply the amount
          of such reduction against any future HCP Service Fee(s) or any HCP
          True-Up Invoice(s) requiring a payment by the Company, or elect to
          have HCP pay such amount in cash to the Company within thirty (30)
          days after receipt of such invoice or the termination of this
          Agreement. (c) All payments under this Agreement shall be grossed-up
          to cover any sales tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax or
          similar tax (“Taxes”) payable with respect to the provision of
          Services (but excluding any tax based upon or measured by the net
          income of HCP or the Company), and each Party shall be responsible for
          paying any such Taxes to the appropriate governmental authority with
          respect to the provision of Services. Upon written request, each Party
          shall submit to the other Party an original receipt by the applicable
          tax authority (or such other evidence as shall be reasonably
          satisfactory to the other Party) evidencing the payment of Taxes with
          respect to the provision of Services. The Parties shall cooperate with
          each other to minimize any applicable Taxes and each shall provide the
          other with any reasonable certificates or documents which are useful
          for such purpose. (d) Each Party shall provide to the other an invoice
          (each, an “Initial Invoice”) reflecting the Base Price, as applicable,
          for any services (and any related costs and expenses) provided to, or
          for the benefit 5 of, of the other party during the period beginning
          on October 1, 2011 and ending on the date of this Agreement. Each
          Initial Invoice shall be in such reasonable detail as to identify the
          services provided and by whom, the amounts charged therefor and any
          incurred out-of-pocket expenses. Upon written request, each Party
          shall provide the other with copies of invoices from any third parties
          for such out-of-pocket expenses. The Initial Invoices of the Company
          and HCP shall be netted and the remainder shall be paid within thirty
          (30) days thereafter or such other period of time as the Parties shall
          agree to in writing. 6. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION. (a)
          The Company Entities shall have no liability with respect to, and
          shall not be obligated to indemnify or hold harmless the HCP Entities,
          or its affiliates, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents or
          other representatives from or against any cost, loss, expense, damage
          or liability arising out of or otherwise in respect of the performance
          of the Company Services other than any such cost, loss, expense,
          damage or liability resulting from the willful misconduct or fraud of
          the Company Entities or any of its directors, managers, officers,
          employees, partners, members or agents. The HCP Entities shall have no
          liability with respect to, and shall not be obligated to indemnify or
          hold harmless the Company Entities, or its affiliates, officers,
          directors, managers, employees, agents or other representatives from
          or against any cost, loss, expense, damage or liability arising out of
          or otherwise in respect of the performance of the HCP Services other
          than any such cost, loss, expense, damage or liability resulting from
          the willful misconduct or fraud of the HCP Entities or any of its
          directors, managers, officers, employees, partners, members or agents.
          A Party entitled to indemnification hereunder shall give written
          notice to the indemnifying party, in reasonable detail, promptly upon
          learning of any claim, suit or proceeding for which indemnification
          may be sought, provided that failure to do so shall have no effect
          except to the extent the indemnifying party is prejudiced thereby. The
          indemnified party may choose to participate in the defense of any
          claim or suit, at its own expense and with its own choice of counsel,
          but the indemnifying party shall have the right to control the defense
          and settlement, provided that the indemnifying party shall not,
          without the indemnified party’s prior written consent, settle any
          claim that increases the indemnified party’s costs or adversely
          affects the indemnified party’s rights. (b) Notwithstanding the terms
          of any indemnification agreement between the HCP Entities or the
          Company Entities and those persons who will be providing Services
          under this Agreement (each an “Indemnification Agreement”), each such
          Indemnification Agreement shall continue in full force and effect with
          respect to the Services provided hereunder subject to the exclusions
          set forth in Section 6(a). The indemnification pursuant to the
          Indemnification Agreements shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
          rights to which such persons may be entitled under the HCP Entities’
          or the Company Entities’ organizational or governing documents or
          under any other agreement, contract of insurance, vote of
          stockholders, members, or disinterested directors or managers, or
          otherwise, or of the broader power of the HCP Entities or the Company
          Entities to indemnify an agent of the HCP Entities or the Company
          Entities as authorized by applicable law. 6 (c) Except as required by
          applicable law or legal process, no advice rendered by any individual
          providing Services pursuant to this Agreement, whether formal or
          informal, may be disclosed, in whole or in part, or summaries,
          excerpted from or otherwise referred to without the Company’s or HCP’s
          prior written consent, as applicable. In addition, except as required
          by applicable law or legal process, such individual’s role under this
          Agreement may not be otherwise disclosed or referred to without the
          Company’s or HCP’s prior written consent, as applicable. (d)
          Notwithstanding the provision of certain legal services from time to
          time pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (i) neither the Company
          Entities nor any of the Company Service Providers shall be responsible
          for supervising the HCP Entities’ legal, regulatory or compliance
          functions, and (ii) neither the HCP Entities nor any of the HCP
          Service Providers shall be responsible for supervising the Company
          Entities’ legal, regulatory or compliance functions. The Parties agree
          that they share a common interest in the subject matter of HCP
          Entities’ and the Company Entities’ communications, information and
          materials, including attorney-client communications, attorney
          work-product and other privileged or protected information. Subject to
          the confidentiality restrictions set forth in Section 9 of this
          Agreement, the Parties are hereby entering into a voluntary sharing of
          confidential communication, information and materials, including
          attorney-client communications, attorney work-product and other
          privileged or protected information of the HCP Entities and the
          Company Entities. The Company Entities’ lawyers providing legal
          services to the HCP Entities, and the HCP Entities’ lawyers providing
          legal services to the Company Entities, shall have an attorney-client
          relationship with the HCP Entities and the Company Entities,
          respectively, and it is intended by the Parties that communication
          among the HCP Entities’ and the Company Entities’ lawyers and the work
          product of those lawyers shall enjoy the benefits of the
          attorney-client privilege, the attorney work-product immunity, joint
          defense and/or any other applicable privilege, immunity or protection.
          The protection of the attorney-client privilege, the attorney
          work-product immunity, joint defense and/or any other applicable
          privilege, immunity or protection are not waived for any
          communication, information or materials of the HCP Entities or the
          Company Entities that may be exchanged among the Company Entities and
          the HCP Entities and their respective counsel, whether or not such
          counsel is an employee of the Company Entities or the HCP Entities.
          This Agreement does not affect the independent and separate
          relationship of the Parties and their respective attorneys, nor shall
          it require disclosure by the Parties’ counsel of their respective
          information to the other Party. Notwithstanding any other provision
          hereof, the limitations on liability included in this Agreement shall
          not apply to legal services to the extent that such limitation or
          liability would contravene any applicable ethical code, code of
          responsibility or other legal, administrative or regulatory
          requirement. 7 7. EMPLOYEES DEEMED TO BE CONSULTANTS. Employees of a
          Party engaged in performing the Services shall be considered to be
          providing such Services to the other Party as its consultants. Under
          no circumstances (including federal, state and local law) shall such
          employees be considered to be employees of the other Party or any of
          its subsidiaries. 8. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. In performing the
          Services, each Party shall be an independent contractor and neither
          Party shall be deemed to be an agent, partner or co-venturer of the
          other due to the terms and provisions of this Agreement. For the
          avoidance of doubt, neither Party nor any of its employees, partners,
          officers or agents shall have any right, power or authority to bind
          the other Party in any manner whatsoever, except at the express
          instruction of such other Party. 9. CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY
          INFORMATION. (a) In addition to any confidential and proprietary
          information that the Company Service Providers or the HCP Service
          Providers heretofore developed, learned or became aware of as
          employees, directors, managers, officers, stockholders or members of a
          Party (collectively, the “Prior Confidential Information”), either
          Party may, in connection with the provision of the Services under this
          Agreement, provide to the other Party or such individuals and confide
          in any of them additional confidential and proprietary information
          (collectively, the “Additional Confidential Information”), including:
          (i) business methods and systems, techniques and methods of operation
          developed by each Party or its affiliates and which the other Party
          recognizes to be unique assets; (ii) any research or data of any kind;
          or (iii) any information relating to strategic plans or the financial
          condition of either Party or their respective affiliates. All the
          Prior Confidential Information and all the Additional Confidential
          Information are herein sometimes referred to collectively as
          “Confidential Information”. Neither Party nor any of the individuals
          that provide the Services shall, either during or at any time after
          the Term, directly or indirectly, in any manner utilize or disclose
          any Confidential Information to any individual, firm, corporation,
          company, association or other entity without the prior consent of the
          other Party (unless legally compelled to do so, but subject to the
          provisions of Section 9(b) or otherwise permitted by Section 9(d));
          provided however, that only to the extent necessary to allow the
          provision of Services, the Company Entities or the HCP Entities and/or
          any of the individuals that provide the Services may disclose
          Confidential Information in a limited manner reasonably calculated to
          ensure non-disclosure of such information. The term “Confidential
          Information” does not include information, knowledge or factual data
          that: (A) becomes part of the public knowledge or literature, other
          than as a result of disclosure thereof by a Party or any of the
          individuals that provide the Services in breach of this Agreement; (B)
          was disclosed to the Company Entities, the HCP Entities or any of the
          individuals that provide the Services on a non-confidential basis by a
          third party that is known by the Company Entities, 8 the HCP Entities
          or any of the individuals that provide the Services, after reasonable
          inquiry, to have the right to disclose the same; (C) was independently
          developed by the either Party, their affiliates or agents or any of
          the individuals that provide the Services; or (D) was already known to
          the Parties, their affiliates or agents or any of the individuals that
          provide the Services before they received such information and was not
          obtained from a source known by the Parties, their agents or any of
          the individuals that provide the Services, after reasonable inquiry,
          to have been prohibited from the right to disclose the same. (b) If a
          Party or any individual that provides the Services on behalf of such
          Party becomes legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request
          for documents, order, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar
          process issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a
          governmental body) to disclose any Confidential Information, then such
          Party will give prompt prior notice of such requirement to the other
          Party so that the other Party or any of its affiliates may seek a
          protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance
          with the terms of this Agreement. If such protective order or other
          remedy is not obtained then only that portion of the Confidential
          Information that is required to be disclosed will be disclosed by such
          Party or the individual that provides the Services on behalf of such
          Party, and commercially reasonable efforts will be made by that Party
          to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
          portion of such Confidential Information; provided, subject to Section
          4, the Party required to disclose the Confidential Information may
          require the other Party, to either (i) advance the third party costs
          and expenses necessary for such Party to seek to obtain such
          confidential treatment or (ii) reimburse its out-of-pocket costs and
          expenses incurred to seek to obtain such assurance of confidential
          treatment hereunder. (c) The provisions herein governing Confidential
          Information shall be separate and in addition to any other agreements
          or obligations that each Party and their partners, employees, or
          agents may be subject to regarding the confidential, trade secret
          and/or proprietary nature of information related to the other Party or
          its affiliates and the provisions set forth herein shall not in any
          way supersede or otherwise limit any such other agreements or
          obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions herein
          governing Confidential Information shall supersede any other
          agreements or obligations regarding such information only to the
          extent necessary to allow the Services to be performed as contemplated
          by this Agreement. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
          this Section 9 or any other agreement among the Parties in effect on
          the date hereof, each Company Entity that has reporting obligations
          under applicable securities laws (including Sections 13(a) and 15(d)
          of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) shall be permitted to disclose
          in its filings required thereunder any information required to be
          disclosed therein under applicable law or the rules of any applicable
          stock exchange. 9 10. COOPERATION AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION. (a) The
          Company and HCP shall each appoint as many as two (2) employees
          occupying a senior management role with the Company and HCP,
          respectively, to coordinate the provision of Services (each such
          person, a “Service Coordinator”). Each Service Coordinator shall have
          the authority and responsibility to: (i) represent the appointing
          Party in relation to this Agreement and make appropriate decisions on
          day-to-day issues subject to the terms of this Agreement; (ii)
          coordinate the technical aspects of the Services and consult on the
          operation and management of the Services; (iii) monitor the appointing
          Party’s compliance with its obligations under this Agreement and
          review the performance of the Services; and (iv) resolve any dispute
          between the Parties. (b) In the event of a dispute hereunder between
          HCP and the Company that the Service Coordinators are unable to
          resolve within five (5) days (a “Dispute”), a senior officer of the
          Company and a senior officer of HCP shall attempt within a period of
          seven (7) days thereafter, or such longer period as the Parties may
          agree (the “Resolution Period”), to conclusively resolve the Dispute.
          If a Dispute remains unresolved after the expiration of the Resolution
          Period, then either Party may deliver to the other Party a written
          notice along with reasonable supporting detail (a “Dispute Notice”)
          with respect to such Dispute and the Parties shall negotiate in good
          faith to resolve any such Dispute, and any resolution agreed to in
          writing by the Parties shall be final and binding upon the Parties. If
          the Parties have not reached a final resolution within thirty (30)
          days from the date of delivery of any Dispute Notice, then each Party
          shall have the right to cause the matter to be submitted to an
          arbitrator, who shall be selected by the American Arbitration
          Association and shall have expertise in the subject matter of the
          Dispute Notice (the “Arbitrator”), whose written final decision shall
          be final and binding upon the Parties. The fees, expenses and costs of
          the Arbitrator shall be borne equally by each Party except to the
          extent specifically awarded otherwise by the Arbitrator. All materials
          submitted to the Arbitrator (including the final decision of the
          Arbitrator) shall be considered Confidential Information and subject
          to Section 9 hereof. (c) The Service Coordinators shall meet as often
          as necessary in order to promptly (i) oversee the implementation and
          application of this Agreement, (ii) resolve any disputes submitted to
          it by any representative of either Party and (iii) discuss any delay,
          disruptions, suspension or outage in the provision of any Service. (d)
          Each of the Parties shall have the right to change its Service
          Coordinators at any time by providing written notice to the other
          Party. 11. BOOKS AND RECORDS. During the Term and for three (3) years
          following the termination of this Agreement (or such shorter period of
          time agreed to in writing by the Parties), each Party shall in the
          ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice keep
          books and records of the Services provided and 10 reasonable
          supporting documentation of all charges incurred in connection with
          providing such Services, and shall make such books and records
          available to the other Party and its representatives, upon reasonable
          notice, during normal business hours, and as necessary to comply with
          any compelled disclosure described in Section 9(b) or other
          circumstances in which information regarding the Services is required
          by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, order, subpoena,
          civil investigative demand or similar process issued by a court of
          competent jurisdiction or by a governmental body. 12. ENTIRE
          AGREEMENT; WAIVERS AND AMENDMENTS. This Agreement sets forth the
          entire understanding between the Company and HCP relating to the
          subject matter hereof, superseding all prior understandings and
          agreements, whether written or oral. Except as provided herein, this
          Agreement shall not be modified or amended, and no provision hereof
          shall be waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by each of
          the Parties hereto, or in the case of a waiver, by the Party hereto
          against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced; provided that
          however any waiver, modification or amendment to the terms of this
          Agreement, must be approved by a majority of the Independent
          Directors. 13. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The provisions of this
          Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
          Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No
          Party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
          obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of
          the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party (or such
          Party’s permitted successive assignees or transferees hereunder) may
          assign or transfer this Agreement as a whole without consent to one or
          more of such Party’s affiliates or to an entity that succeeds to all
          or substantially all of the business or assets of such Party. 14. NO
          THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. The HCP Service Providers and the Company
          Service Providers shall be deemed third party beneficiaries solely of
          the provisions set forth in Section 6 of this Agreement. Except as
          provided in the preceding sentence, nothing in this Agreement shall
          confer any rights upon any person which is not a party or a successor
          or permitted assignee of a party to this Agreement. 15. TERMINATION.
          This Agreement may be terminated at any time by the written agreement
          of the Parties as provided in Section 1 hereof. Notwithstanding the
          foregoing and any other provision contained herein, the following
          Sections of this Agreement shall remain in effect and shall survive
          the termination of this Agreement: Section 5, Billing; Section 6,
          Limitation on Liability; Indemnification; Section 9, Confidential and
          Proprietary Information; Section 10, Cooperation and Dispute
          Resolution; Section 13, Successors and Assigns; and Section 14, No
          Third Party Beneficiaries. 16. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be
          governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
          State of New York, without regard to the conflict of laws principles
          thereof. 11 17. NOTICES. All written notices, demands and other
          communications given to or made by either Party to the other in
          connection with this Agreement shall be either personally served on an
          officer or other authorized representative of the Party to which it is
          given or mailed by registered first class mail, postage prepaid, to
          the headquarters of such Party to the attention of its chief financial
          officer, with a copy to its general counsel, or to such other address
          and to the attention of such persons as the Party in question may from
          time to time specify to the other by notice hereunder. All notices
          shall be deemed delivered and effective (a) if hand-delivered, upon
          delivery, or (b) if mailed, three (3) business days after mailing. 18.
          INTERPRETATION. Unless otherwise expressly provided, for the purposes
          of this Agreement, the following rules of interpretation shall apply:
          (a) The section and sub-section headings contained in this Agreement
          are for convenience of reference only and will not affect in any way
          the meaning or interpretation hereof. (b) When a reference is made in
          this Agreement to a section, paragraph or clause, such reference will
          be to a section, paragraph or clause hereof unless otherwise clearly
          indicated to the contrary. (c) Whenever the words “include,”
          “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they will be
          deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” (d) The words
          “hereof,” “herein” and “herewith” and words of similar import will,
          unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a

          attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. 12 19.

          counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all
